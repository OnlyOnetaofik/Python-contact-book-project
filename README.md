# Python-contact-book-project

This project's primary objective is to become familiar with fundamental Python concepts. Despite the fact that this is a step-by-step guide by [sdmalfian](https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-make-a-contact-book-application-using-python-9db4f8dfa4fe), I learned a great deal from this project and was even able to implement certain features in my code, such as importing custom modules, try/except errors, dictionaries, lists, and methods, among others.

The fie tree for this project is shown below.
